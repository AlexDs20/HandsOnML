# Training models:
# Use two methods to train models for linear regression:
#       - Exact solution that minimizes the cost function on the training set
#       - Gradient descent: iterative steps to approach a solution (and will look at alternatives to GD. Batch-GD, mini-batch GD and stochastic GD)
# Next: polynomial regression: more complex model which can overfit:
#       - use learning curves ot see if overfitting
#       - look at regularization techniques that reduces the risk of overfitting
# 2 more models used for classifications:
#       - Logistic regression
#       - Softmax Regression
